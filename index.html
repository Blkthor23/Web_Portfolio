                    I previously worked as a Help Desk Tier 2 and System Administrator. 
                    I currently hold several certifications, including Comptia Security+, Slack Administrator, Jamf 100, and AWS Cloud Practitioner. 
                    I'm originally from Los Angeles, CA. but am currently located in Aubrey, TX. 
                    My passion for being a developer, like many, developed from my love of video games.</p>
